        <h1>About Rust Programming Language</h1>
        <p>Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, concurrency, and performance. It is designed to be memory safe without sacrificing performance, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.</p>
        <p>Key features of Rust include:</p> <p>I added this</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory Safety:</strong> Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without the need for a garbage collector.</li>
            <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Rust provides powerful tools for writing concurrent code, including threads and async/await syntax.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Rust achieves performance comparable to C and C++ by providing fine-grained control over memory layout and execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero-cost Abstractions:</strong> Rust allows developers to write high-level code without sacrificing performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether you're building system software, web applications, or anything in between, Rust offers a powerful and safe toolset for your projects.</p>
